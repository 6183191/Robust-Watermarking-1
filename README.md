# Robust-Watermarking

Robust and Secure Watermarking using SVD & DWT

This a secure and robust watermarking scheme based on singular values replacement and DWT transformation.

The technique is described in the following paper: https://github.com/shreyverma03/Robust-Watermarking-/blob/master/dwtonlinepaper.pdf

What it does and how to use it:


If you just want to hide a logo "let's say a watermark message (a.k.a image)" inside another image then simply open "dwt_svd.m"

Execute the dwt_svd.m from matlab command window and watch the figures.

Decomposition upto 1st step-4th step , Watermarked Image , Watermark Logo , Extracted Watermark all can be achieved by executing  "dwt_svd.m".
